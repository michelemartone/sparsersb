 -- Loadable Function: S = sparsersb (A)
     Create a sparse RSB matrix from the full matrix A.

 -- Loadable Function: S = sparsersb (FILENAME)
     Create a sparse RSB matrix by loading the Matrix Market matrix
     file named FILENAME.  In the case FILENAME is "?", a string
     listing the available numerical types with BLAS-style characters
     will be returned.

 -- Loadable Function: S = sparsersb (I, J, SV, M, N, NZMAX)
     Create a sparse RSB matrix given integer index vectors I and J, a
     1-by-`nnz' vector of real of complex values SV, overall dimensions
     M and N of the sparse matrix.  The argument `nzmax' is ignored but
     accepted for compatibility with MATLAB.

     *Note*: if multiple values are specified with the same I, J
     indices, the corresponding values in S will be added.

     The following are all equivalent:

          s = sparsersb (i, j, s, m, n)
          s = sparsersb (i, j, s, m, n, "summation")
          s = sparsersb (i, j, s, m, n, "sum")

 -- Loadable Function: S = sparsersb (I, J, S, M, N, "unique")
     Same as above, except that if more than two values are specified
     for the same I, J indices, the last specified value will be used.

 -- Loadable Function: S = sparsersb (I, J, SV)
     Uses `M = max (I)', `N = max (J)'

 -- Loadable Function: S = sparsersb (M, N)
     Equivalent to `sparsersb ([], [], [], M, N, 0)'

     Please note that on `sparsersb' type variables are available most,
     but not all of the operators available for `full' or `sparse'
     typed variables.
